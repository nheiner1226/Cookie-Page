			My favorite cartoon character is Cookie Monster, and my favorite dessert is cupcakes, 
			so Cookie Monster cupcakes are the best of both worlds.

			Did you know? Cookie Monster once said, <q>Sometimes me think what is love, 
			and then me think love is what last cookie is for. Me give up the last cookie for 
			you.</q> I wonder if the same applies for cupcakes? (If so, I don't think I can ever love ANYONE!)
